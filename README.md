## Features

### Groups

A group serves as a container for game servers. Using groups allows you to conveniently organize game servers.

- Each group has a name and a description, which you can change at any time;
- A group can contain any number of game servers;

### Servers

- Initially, you use a global nickname for all servers, but you can also assign a local name to a specific server, which will be used instead of the global one when connecting to that server;
- You can incorporate various files that modify the game, for both all servers and specific ones;
- You can easily change the server address if it ever changes, so you won't have to re-enter server information (like custom name or description, local nickname, etc.) from scratch;
- You can clone an already added server to make any changes (set a local nickname for the server, add the incorporation of specific game modification files, etc.).
- You can set up a mode for continuous server information updates. You can activate a mode where information for all servers in the active group will be refreshed. You can also specify the delay between receiving server information;
- You can search for servers by name;
- You can sort servers by name, ping, number of players, etc;
- Each server has an official name, but you can set your own name for the server;
- You can add a specific description to the server;
